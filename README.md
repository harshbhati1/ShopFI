## ℹ️ Additional Information

The idea for Shofi originated from my personal experience working at my father's shop. I observed how manual record-keeping led to losses due to forgotten customer dues. Inspired by this, I developed Shofi at the age of 18, leveraging my knowledge in computer science and app development gained through learning Flutter, Firebase, and state management with Riverpod. Future plans include implementing customer confirmation for log edits, OTP verification, and integrated payment methods.
